Spiro release 0.01
4 May 2007
Raph Levien

This is a very rough release of the Spiro toolset that I've been using
to create my fonts. The main program is ppedit, and there's a more
detailed README in that directory.

To build ppedit, do:

cd ppedit
make

It requires Gtk2 and cairo.

The curves/ subdirectory contains python utilities for manipulating
curves, including a Bezier optimizer.

The font/ subdirectory contains tools for segmenting scans and
compositing them into classes, suitable for tracing over. (Note,
however, that the gtk2 build of ppedit doesn't yet load background
images for tracing).

Always see http://levien.com/spiro/ for more updates.
