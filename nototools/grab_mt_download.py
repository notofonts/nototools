"""Copy downloaded font zip files from Monotype into noto directory
structure.

This leverages some properties of the font drops.  The drops come in
zip files with an underscore and 8-digit date suffix before the extension.
This reflects the date of the drop. For each zip of this type we build
a root named for the date in the target directory.

Most drops contain a two-level tree with the font name and a suffix of
either '_hinted or '_unhinted' on the top level, and the relevant data
underneath.  Our structure just uses 'hinted' or 'unhinted', so we
convert, putting these under the root for the zip.

Some drops have a single level tree, we examine the fonts to determine if
they have hints (probably all do not) and assign it to one of our trees based
on that.

Other files with names matching the font name (in particular, .csv files
corresponding to our linter output) are put into the folder matching the
font.  Files that are not in a two-level hierarchy and do not correspond to
a font are put at the top level.

Other tools (for updating the internal staging repo) work off the structure
built by this tool.
