"""Copy downloaded font zip files from Adobe into noto directory structure.

This leverages some properties of the font drops. The drops come in
zip files that look like this, if you select the Noto Sans CJK subfolder from
the Adobe Sans Version x.xxx folder on google drive and ask to download it:
  Noto_Sans_CJK-yyyy-mm-dd.zip

This reflects the date of the download. For each zip of this type we build
a root named for the date in the drops subdir of the adobe_data tree.

The drops contain a multi-level tree:
  OTF-Fallback (these are for Android and don't go in to Noto)
  OTC (the ttc fonts, weight specific and ginormous)
  OTF-Subset (language-specific subsets, 7 weights each)
    JP (e.g. NotoSansJP-Thin.otf)
    KR
    SC
    TC
  OTF (language defaults, 7 weights plus 2 mono weights each)
    JP (e.g. NotoSansCJKjp-Thin.otf, NotoSansMonoCJKjp-Regular.otf)
    KR
    SC
    TC

The data built under the drops subdir is flat, and does not include the
fallback files.

The Noto zips from Adobe don't have any other files in them (Adobe puts their
metadata in the Source Han Sans directory). This assumes the zip is only the
Noto directory.
